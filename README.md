# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Internship Task
This project is completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.  
Task 2 focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Dataset Name:** Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster
- **File Used:** train.csv

The dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Asked meaningful questions before analysis  
2. Loaded and explored the dataset structure  
3. Checked missing values and data quality issues  
4. Performed descriptive statistical analysis  
5. Identified trends and patterns using visualizations  
6. Summarized key insights and conclusions  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates than males
- Passenger class significantly affected survival chances
- Higher ticket fare passengers showed better survival
- Missing values were observed in Age and Cabin columns

---
## How to Run
Open and run the notebook `task2_EDA.ipynb` using Jupyter or Google Colab.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This EDA helped in understanding survival patterns and data quality issues in the Titanic dataset.  
The analysis provides a strong foundation for further predictive modeling.
